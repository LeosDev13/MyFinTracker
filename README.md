# 📱 MyFinTracker

**A mobile app to truly take control of your personal finances.**

## 🧠 Why this app?

I’ve always been fairly responsible with money — but mostly just by instinct. Back when I lived with my parents, it was easy. Living alone? A bit trickier. Living with a partner and adopting a puppy? Now we're talking complexity.

After failing a personal goal (not going below a certain number in my account) for two months in a row, I realized my financial situation wasn't bad — what was lacking was a **system to track it properly**. That's when I said: I'm a developer, why not build a solution for myself… and maybe others?

I tried Excel, I tried some existing apps — but Excel never felt intuitive to me, and other apps always fell short. One thing that always bothered me: I might pay for something on behalf of someone, then get paid back (e.g. Bizum or Venmo), and I don't want that to count as either income or expense. I want to settle that.

Also… we’re devs. We like solving our own problems.
